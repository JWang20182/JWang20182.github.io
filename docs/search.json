Only SEQN and the selected outcome and predictor variables are retained from the raw data, and then subjects with complete cases for the selected variables are filtered.

For each numerical variable, a histogram, a QQ-Norm plot, and a boxplot with violin, are made. These plots show the data distribution, the mean and the quantiles, as well as outliers. It is also easy to determine whether data follows a normal distribution. A bar chart is provided for Gender variable.\nSysBP is right-skewed with outliers in the right tail. The range is from 70 to 220 mmHg, with the mean (125 mmHg) bigger than the median. The distribution is not normal.\ndiaBP very slightly right-skewed, probably due to the outliers in the right tail. The range is from 40 to 140 mmHg, with both the mean and the median close to 75 mmHg. The distribution is almost normal except for the outliers on the right.\nHbA1c is right-skewed with a lot of outliers on the right. The range is from 3% to 16%, while the majority of data is between 4% to 9%. The mean is bigger than the median.\nAge ranges from 21 to 79 years, with an even distribution between 22 and 50 years. The mode occurs at 60 years, and the distribution tapers off at both younger and older ages. The mean is 50 years and the median is 51 years.\nThe female and male subjects each make up about 50% of the total sample, with slightly more female subjects.\n\n2.2.1 Dashboard for This Part\nA Data Summaries page is created to display the summaries. The page is divided into two columns: the first column contains a tab set with two tabs, one for systolic blood pressure and the other for diastolic blood pressure; the second column has a narrow row for Gender and a wider row with a tab set containing one tab for each of HbA1c and Age."

    "text": "2.3 Build Linear Models\nTo test the hypothesis, SysBP is to be treated as outcome, diaBP, HbA1c, Age, and Gender will be treated as predictors.\n\n2.3.1 Develop Training and Test Samples for Analysis\nA random sample of 75% of the data is selected for model training, and the remaining 25% is hold out for model testing. For reproducibility, use set.seed when partitioning the data.\n\n\n2.3.2 Develop Candidate Models Using the Training Sample\nStudy the outcome variable SysBP in the training sample to consider whether a transformation might be in order.\nLike in the data summaries section, a histogram overlayed with a normal distribution, a QQ-Norm plot, and a boxplot with violin is created using SysBP in the training sample. The data distribution of SysBP is obviously right skewed and deviates from the normal distribution.\nBox-Cox suggests a transformation with a \\(\\lambda\\) at about -0.8, to make the transformation easier to comprehend. I decide to use a inverse transformation, which is close to the Box-Cox suggestion. The same three plots are created for 1/SysBP, and now it can be approximated to a normal distribution. The transformation of outcome variable is in an attempt to help make the linear regression assumptions of linearity, normality and constant variance more appropriate.\nA scatterplot matrix is made by ggpairs. 1/SysBP is put first. In the plots from the first column, it is obvious that DiaBP has a stronger correlation to 1/SysBP than the other two numerical variables. In the information from the first row, it is observed that the correlation coefficient of DiaBP is highest and that of HbA1c is lowest among the variables. There is a slight difference of 1/SysBP between the two genders.\n\n\n2.3.3 Fit Regression Models\nUse lm to fit regression models with different numbers of prediction variables. Get the coefficients, standard error, P value, and 90% confidence interval for each model with tidy.\nModel 1 uses DiaBP as the only predictor, since the outcome is inverse transformed, the estimated coefficient is a small negative number, so are the higher and lower bounds of the confidence interval. Since the confidence interval does not include 0, there is a negative association between 1/SysBP and DiaBP, when the outcome variable is transformed back, the correlation is positive.\nModel 2 uses DiaBP and Age as predictors. Estimated coefficient and its confidence interval are negative for both predictors, indicating a positive correlation between both predictors and the original outcome.\nModel 3 uses DiaBP, Age and HbA1c as predictors. Estimated coefficient and its confidence interval are negative for all predictors, indicating a positive correlation between all predictors and the original outcome.\nModel 4 uses DiaBP, Age, HbA1c and Gender as predictors. Estimated coefficient and its confidence interval are negative for all numerical predictors, indicating a positive correlation between these predictors and the original outcome; estimated coefficient and its confidence interval are positive for Gender, indicating the mean SysBP of female subjects is lower than that of male subjects.\n\n\n2.3.4 Dashboard for This Part\nA page is built for this part with three tabs, one for each subsection.\nIn the Data Partition and Outcome Transformation tab, there are two columns. In the first column, The top panel displays a table of the split samples, and the bottom panel shows the plots for SysBP in the training sample. In the second column, the top panel displays the Box-Cox plot, and the bottom panel shows the plots for transformed outcome variable in the training sample. The comparison of the two lower panels indicates that the transformation helps the data to become more normally distributed.\nIn the second tab, the scatterplot matrix is created for all variables involved in the analysis.\nIn Linear Models tab, four linear models are built. Each row has the regression equation of the model on the left, and a table of coefficients on the right."

R2 measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. Adjusted R2 accounts for the number of predictors to prevent overfitting. Sigma estimates the residual standard error, reflecting the model’s accuracy. AIC evaluates model quality, balancing goodness of fit and complexity. BIC assesses model fit with a stronger penalty for additional predictors. The information is obtained using glance.\nThe results indicate that Model 4 performs the best overall. It has the highest R2 (0.5879) and adjusted R2 (0.5876), suggesting that it best explains variability in 1/SysBP without overfitting among all four models; its lowest sigma (0.00077), AIC (-58223.8) and BIC (-58184.7) indicate the best accuracy among the four models. Models 2 and Model 3 perform similarly, with slight differences R2, AIC and BIC. Model 1 has the worst fit quality among the four.\nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table comparing four models is created by anova. The RSS decreases with each added predictor, indicating an improvement in the model’s ability to explain variability in 1/SysBP. The small P values, which are less than 0.05 for each additional variable, suggesting that every additional variable in these four models is a meaningful predictor of 1/SysBP.\n\n\n2.4.2 Check Regression Assumptions\nThe regression assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality are checked by four residual plots.\nThe plot of Residuals vs Fitted shows linearity in all four models. Model 1 exhibits a funnel shape, indicating non-constant variance in the residuals, while the other three models meet the homoscedasticity assumption.\nThe plot of Scale-Location looks good for all models.\nPlots of Q-Q Residuals and Residuals vs Leverage look good for all four models except for a few outliers.\nAll four predictors are independent, and none of them depend on another predictor.\n\n\n2.4.3 Check Collinearity of Predictors\nUse vif to check the collinearity of predictors. All VIFs are about 1, indicating no collinearity between the predictors.\n\n\n2.4.4 Prediction Errors\nPrediction is carried out using the test sample. augment and mathematical methods are used to obtain mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), max error, and median absolute prediction error for each model.\nThe results indicate that Model 4 performs the best overall, with the lowest MAPE (9.536%), RMSPE (13.150%), max error (72.78), and median absolute prediction error (7.260), suggesting it provides more accurate and consistent predictions compared to the other models. Models 2 and Model 3 perform similarly, with slight differences in RMSPE and max error. Model 1 has the highest error metrics, indicating the lowest predictive accuracy among the four.\n\n\n2.4.5 Dashboard for This Part\nA page is created for this part with four tabs, one for each subsection.\nIn the In-sample Fit Quality page, the top panel is a table of R2, adjusted R2, sigma, AIC, and BIC for four models, the bottom panel is the ANOVA table comparing four models. It is easy to see that Model 4 is the best fitting model with the highest R2 and adjust R2, and lowest sigma, AIC and BIC.\nThe Check Regression Assumptions page has four tabs, one for each model. There are four plots in each tab to help check linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.\nThe Check Collinearity of Predictors tab uses VIF to check the collinearity, there is no concern of collinearity.\nIn Prediction Errors tab, prediction is made, and MAPE, RMSPE, max error and median absolute prediction error of all four models are listed.
